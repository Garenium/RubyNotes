The `split` function splits words (where the delimeter is a white-space character by default) and forms them into an array.

### 1.1.0 The `split` function

```ruby
	typeVar = "Hello, are you here?".split
	puts typeVar << "\n" #mutating the string (not appending like in +)
	puts typeVar.class
```

### 1.1.1 Concatenating
The `+` operator does not modify the original string. Instead, it creates a new string 'JohnField'. Take note if you're dealing with large scale string manipulations.

Just like `<<`, the `concat` method does not involve creating a new string.

`<<` is an alias of `concat`.

```ruby
	puts 'John' + 'Field' #This is slow concatenation

	puts "Elvis".concat("Presley") 
```

### 1.1.2 Replacing a substring

There are different methods to replace a substring. The methods are:

- `sub`: Replaces the first occurrence of the specified substring (1st arg) to a new one (2nd arg)
- `gsub`: (Think of "global substitution") Replaces all occurrences of the specified substring

They both return a modified string.

We use the `sub` method to replace a the first occurrence of a specified substring (first arg) to a new one (second argument).

```ruby
	last_name = "Sparrow"
	puts "I am Jack Sparrow.".sub("Sparrow", "Black")

	puts "Society & liberty".gsub("y", "Ã©")
```

You can also use a regex (regular expression) to replace substrings.
```ruby
	#Here we're replaceing every capital to 0
	puts 'RubyMonk Is Pretty Brilliant'.gsub(/[RMIPB]/,'0')
```

### 1.1.3 Finding a substring using RegEx

With the `match` method, we can find a substring based on our passing regEx argument.  We use regEx if we can't find the exact substring (kinda like querying a database)

```ruby
	'RubyMonk Is Pretty Brilliant'.match(/ ./, 9)
```
