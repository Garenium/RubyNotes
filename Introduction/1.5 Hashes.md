### 1.5.0 Syntax and Fetching Values

More Info: https://ruby-doc.org/3.2.2/Hash.html

There are two ways to create a hash. One is by using a hash rocket `=>` and the other is by using a JSON-style colon `:`. 

With a traditional syntax, you can explicitly state the key as a symbol with the colon `:` before it or using double quotes `""` instead. A symbol in Ruby is kind of like a const string and a reference in one. Instead of having multiple strings in a hash, using symbols would be more optimal.

```ruby
#This is invalid syntax. In a traditional syntax, the datatype for the 
#key must be specified as a symbol with : or a string "".
=begin
	my_friend = {
		name => "John",
		age => 19
	}

	p(my_friend[name])
=end

#This is valid
my_friend = {
	:name => "John",
	:age => 19
}

my_friend2 = {
	"name" => "Alex",
	"age" => 20 
}

puts("Printing my_friend and my_friend2...")
p(my_friend[:name])
p(my_friend2["name"])

puts()

student_ages = {
	"Jack": 30,
	"Jill": 22,
	"Bob": 18
}

 #Accessing the property of a hash is different in ruby 
 #In Ruby we use [] just like an array
 puts("Printing student_ages...")
 p()
 p(student_ages[:Jack])
 #This will return nil. It needs to be a symbol regardless of the syntax
 p(student_ages["Jack"])
 
```

Fetching a value is indexing an array in Ruby. We use square brackets `[]` to retrieve a value from our hash exemplified above.

### 1.5.1 Modifying a Hash

It is no different from changing an element of an array by its index. 

```ruby
	menu = {
		"Rice" => 10.5,
		"Chicken" => 25.99,
		"Tea" => 5.5,
		"Bread" => 1.5,
		"Pepsi" => 2.5
	}

	puts("menu before")
	p(menu)
	menu["Pepsi"] = 3.5
	puts()
	p(menu)
```

### 1.5.2 Iterating over a Hash

If you wish to iterate over both the keys and their values, the `each` method can do the trick as it returns both the keys and their values.

```ruby
	restaurant_menu = {
		"Ramen"	=> 3,
		"Dal Makhani" => 4,
		"Coffee" => 2
	}

	#One application is to increase the values of the hash
	#restaurant_menu
	restaurant_menu.each do | item, price |
	  get_price = restaurant_menu[item]
	  new_price = get_price * 0.1 + get_price
	  restaurant_menu[item] = new_price
	end

	restaurant_menu.each do | item, price |
		puts "#{item}: $#{price}"
	end
```

If we want to extract only the keys, use call the `keys` method. For values, we call `values`.

```ruby
	person = {
		:name => "John",
		:age => 19 
	}

	#printing values and keys
	p(person.keys)
	p(person.values)
```

### 1.5.3 Another way to create a Hash

You can a hash by calling `Hash[]` [link](https://ruby-doc.org/3.2.2/Hash.html#method-c-5B-5D)

```ruby
	#An initialized hash object
	fruits = Hash[:apple, 2, :orange, 3]	

	#An empty hash
	empty_hash = Hash.new

	p fruits
	p empty_hash
```
