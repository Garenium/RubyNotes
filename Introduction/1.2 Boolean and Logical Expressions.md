### 1.2.0 Boolean and Logical Operators

Boolean expressions in Ruby are just like in other programming languages. `==`, `!=`,  `<=`, `>=`, `>`, `<`, `||`, `&&`,   `(`,  and `)`.

### 1.2.1 The if-else construct

Since Python relies on identation, you need a `:` to make scopes viable. In Ruby, you don't need `:` as it follows a Pascal-like scoping tradition.

```ruby
	def check_age(age)
		if age < 12
			puts "You're preteen. You are #{age}"
		elsif age < 19
			puts "You're a teenager. You are #{age}"
	end

	name = gets.chomp #chomp is to ignore the newline character
	check_age(age)
```

Ruby also has an `unless` keyword to check for a negative condition. It is synonymous to `if !x`.

```ruby
	age = 18
	unless age >= 16
		puts "You cannot drive as your are under 16 years old"
	else
		puts "You can drive! Get ready drivin'!"
	end
```

### 1.2.2 Ternary operator

Just like any other programming languages, the ternary follows the same syntax.
```
	expression ? expression is true : expression is false
```

### 1.2.3 Different ways to express `true` and `false`

Unlike C where `1` means true and `0` means false, Ruby treats both as true.
The only objects that are false are `false` and `nil`.

See how 0 is treated as true in Ruby:

```ruby
	if 0
		puts "0 is true in Ruby"
	end
```
