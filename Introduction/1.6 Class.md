### 1.6.0 How are they built?

You cannot have an object-oriented programming language without classes. In Ruby, classes can be built as such:

```ruby
class Triangle
	#def initialize(length, breadth)
	#	@length = length
	#	@breadth = breadth
	#end
	
	def perimeter	
		@length + @width + @hypotenuse
	end
end

Triangle.perimeter

```

Variables with `@` become the instance variable of the class. This is what can help distinguish objects with the same datatype. 

Calling a method without instance variables initialized will fail the code.

We need a constructor which is represented like a method called `initializer`.

```ruby
class Triangle

	def initializer(length, width, hypotenuse)
		@length = length
		@width = width 
		@hypotenuse = hypotenuse
	end

	def perimeter
		length + width
	end
end	

triangle = Triangle.initializer(2,1,4)
peri = triangle.perimeter
p peri
```

Note that the perimeter method has no `return`. This is because (like Python), if no return is specified, the last line will automatically be treated as a return value.

### 1.6.1 Grouping Objects

We can look the class of any object by calling the `class` method.

```ruby
	p 1.class
	p "".class
	p [].class
```

There is the method `is_a?` made to be conditional like so:

```ruby
	p 1.is_a?(Integer)
	p 1.is_a?(String)
```

Classes are deemed as inferior to objects. But in Ruby, they are synonymous to objects. Calling the class method repeatedly demonstrates this.

```ruby
p 1.class.class.class.class
```

### 1.6.2 Everything has a class. Including nil (NilClass).

```ruby
	def do_nothing
	end

	puts do_nothing.class
```

This prints out NilClass because there must always be an object one way or another. It is a standalone class/object representing the absence of an object.
