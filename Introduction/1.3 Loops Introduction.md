### 1.3.0 Infinite loops

It is self-explanatory. It is pretty different. This is what it never-ending loop looks like in Ruby.

```ruby
	loop do
		puts "this line will be executed infinitely"
	end
```

It also has the `break` keyword .

```ruby
	#The following will not compile as the me object does not exist
	#It's only here to demonstrate a point	
	loop do
		me.run
		if me.tired?
			break
		end
	end
```

The for loop in Ruby can also syntactically different. It is structured very much like in Japanese. If you wish to say "I drink twice" in Japanese, you would say "twice I drink". 

In Ruby, it is "`N` times I `statement`"

```ruby
	5.times do
		"I'm jumping"
	end

	#If you want to specify the number of times, we add ||
	5.times do |i|
		"I'm jumping #{i} times"
	end
```

```ruby
	def ring(n)
	   i = 0
	   n.times do
	      p "ringing #{n} time(s)"
	      i += 1
	       if i >= 6  # use >= instead of <
		      break
	       end
	   end 
	end  
	times = 0 
	ring(times)
```


But of course, you couldn't go wrong without typing `for` as long as there's something iterable to loop for (same as in Python).

```ruby
	array = [1,2,3,4]
	for i in array 
		puts "At index #{i}"
	end
```

We can also do a for each loop. The following is the same as above but it is just done  differently.

```ruby
	array = [1,2,3,4]
	array.each do |i|
		puts "At index #{i}"
	end
```
