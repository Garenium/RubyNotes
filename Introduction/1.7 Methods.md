### 1.7.0 Objectifying Methods

As the subtitle suggests, in Ruby, the `method` method can hold the reference of the method specified. That way, we can create an object that can do one particular task only.

```ruby 
	#prints the reference to the method next
	p 1.method("next")
```


```ruby
	oneUpper = 9.method("next")
	#prints Method
	p oneUpper.class
	#prints 10 
	p oneUpper.call
```
